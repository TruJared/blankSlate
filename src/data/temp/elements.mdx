# Components

Alkaline includes a variety of components to help you get started with your project. All components are stateless and can be used in any Astro project. They are built using Astro's [component syntax](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/). All should work well with any [Astro supported JavaScript framework](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/#supported-frameworks), including, React, Vue, Svelte, etc...
