## todo: say some nice stuff 😄

The 'documentation' section is really designed to help newer devs get a feel for this theme and to offer an overview of ONE of the ways to approach developing with this theme. However, it is also included as an example of how you can use the theme.

If you are an experienced developer, you should be right at home in this theme. If you do find anything that you think could be improved, [please let me know](https://github.com/TruJared/blankSlate/issues). If it's an obstacle for you, it's likely an obstacle for others as well. 🏃

Throughout the documentation I will also offer some tips and tricks that I have found useful when developing with this theme. Marked with this helpful emoji 💁‍♂️
