astro components use 'className' as an aditional way to pass clases to the component. Explain how they use class:list allowing for dynamic classes.

TODO:

- [ ] Add example of how a user can pass a conditional class to a component.
- [ ] Can we pass conditional classes to the astro components too?
- we can look at this file for example src\components\Astro\CodeCopy.astro
