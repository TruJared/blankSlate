## OBJECTIVE

  To create a theme that is useful for a variety of projects. It should be equally useful to new and experienced developers. Documentation should be clear and explain some features a bit more in depth with references to key materials. Don't expect users to have deep knowledge of the tools used in this theme or the Astro framework.

  This theme should work for those with minimal experience using a framework, but also be useful for those who are more experienced and want to build a more complex site.
