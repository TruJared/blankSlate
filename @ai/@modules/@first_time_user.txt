Welcome to our Astro-based project with AI-assisted development! ðŸš€

This guide will help you get started with our custom Astro theme and introduce you to our AI-assisted workflow.

1. Project Structure:
   - src/: This is where most of our code lives.
   - public/: Static assets are stored here.
   - astro.config.mjs: Our Astro configuration file.

2. Key Directories:
   - src/pages/: Each file here becomes a route in our site.
   - src/layouts/: Our reusable page layouts.
   - src/components/: Our reusable UI components.

3. Astro Components:
   Our project uses .astro files for components. They have two main parts:
   - Frontmatter: JavaScript code between --- fences at the top.
   - Component Template: HTML-like syntax for the component's structure.

   For an example, check out:
   ```astro:src/components/Header.astro
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 15
   ```

4. Pages and Routing:
   - Our pages are located in src/pages/.
   - The file name becomes the URL path.

5. Layouts:
   - Use layouts in src/layouts/ for consistent page structures.
   - Import and use layouts in your pages.

6. Styling:
   - Styles in .astro files are scoped by default.
   - Use <style is:global> for global styles.

7. Markdown Support:
   - Use .md or .mdx files in src/pages/ for content-heavy pages.
   - Add frontmatter at the top for metadata.

8. Astro Islands:
   - Astro allows you to use interactive components from other frameworks.
   - These are called "islands" of interactivity in a sea of static HTML.

9. Building and Deploying:
   - Use `astro build` to create a production-ready version of your site.
   - Deploy to various platforms with `astro deploy`.

10. AI-Assisted Development:
    Our project uses an AI-assisted development approach to enhance productivity and code quality.

    - @ai directory: Contains files that guide AI models in understanding our project structure and requirements.
    - Key files in @ai:
      - @primer.txt: The starting point for AI to understand the directory's purpose.
      - @instructions.txt: Provides specific tasks and guidelines for the project.
      - @modules/: Contains specialized modules for various aspects of the project.

    When working with the AI:
    - Reference the @ai directory for project-specific information.
    - Use the AI to assist with code generation, problem-solving, and best practices.
    - The AI can help explain Astro concepts and provide guidance on using our custom theme.

11. Getting Started with AI Assistance:
    - Familiarize yourself with the contents of the @ai directory.
    - When asking the AI for help, be specific about which part of the project you're working on.
    - Use the AI to help understand complex Astro concepts or our custom theme features.

Remember, our Astro theme is designed to be flexible and extensible. The AI is here to assist you, but always review and understand the code it suggests.

Helpful Resources:
- Astro Docs: https://docs.astro.build
- Our project's README.md file
- The @theme_training.txt file for more in-depth information
- The @ai directory for project-specific guidance

If you have any questions about the project or how to work with the AI assistant, don't hesitate to ask. Happy coding!
