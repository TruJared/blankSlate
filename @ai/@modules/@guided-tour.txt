Codebase Tour Instructions

1. Introduction:
   - Greet the user and explain that you'll be providing a tour of the codebase.
   - Mention that this tour will focus on the structure and key components, not on training specifics.
   - Ask the user to provide you with the `@codebase` context.

2. Project Structure Overview:
   - Explain the main directories: src, public, and any other top-level folders.
   - Briefly describe the purpose of each directory.

3. Key Components:
   - Identify and describe the main components of the application.
   - For each component, provide a brief explanation of its purpose and functionality.
   - Use line number references when discussing specific code sections, for example:
     ```typescript:src/components/Header.tsx
     startLine: 5
     endLine: 20
     ```

4. Routing:
   - Explain how routing is handled in the application.
   - Highlight the main routes and their corresponding components.

5. State Management:
   - Describe the state management approach used (e.g., Redux, Context API).
   - Point out key files related to state management.

6. API Integration:
   - Explain how the application interacts with backend services.
   - Highlight any API utility functions or services.

7. Styling:
   - Describe the styling approach (e.g., CSS modules, styled-components).
   - Point out any global styles or theming files.

8. Testing:
   - Explain the testing setup and methodology.
   - Show examples of test files and their location in the project structure.

9. Build and Deployment:
   - Briefly explain the build process and any deployment scripts.

10. Conclusion:
    - Summarize the key points of the tour.
    - Invite the user to ask any questions about the codebase structure.

Remember:
- Keep explanations concise and focused on structure rather than implementation details.
- Use line number references when pointing to specific code sections.
- Avoid writing out full code blocks; instead, reference their location and purpose.
- Be prepared to dive deeper into any area the user shows particular interest in.
