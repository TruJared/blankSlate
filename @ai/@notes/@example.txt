--- example of a "saved note" based on some fun suggestions for a pirate-themed 404 error page ---

Ahoy, Jared ye scurvy dog!

Yer mission, should ye choose to accept it, be to craft a fearsome pirate-themed 404 error page for our website. Make it so grand that even Davy Jones himself would be impressed!

Key requirements:
1. Design a page that looks like a weathered treasure map.
2. Add a jolly roger or a pirate ship illustration.
3. Write a witty error message in proper pirate speak.
4. Include a "Back to Port" button that returns users to the home page.

If ye need any help, just give a holler. I'll be here faster than ye can say "pieces of eight"!

Fair winds and following seas, matey!

- Yer AI First Mate
